Writing a book is kind of like that argument for believing in god, that if you're right you win and if you're wrong it doesn't matter. So I may as well assume that you like this book, in which case you'll hopefully remember the name. y=mx+b is the equation for a straight line that increments m units in the y direction for every one unit in the x direction and crosses the y-axis at x=0, y=b on the cartesian coordinate grid. You can look for metaphors about the lines that connect us all, but really I just think it's a good thing to know this equation and what it means, even if you never use it. \\
