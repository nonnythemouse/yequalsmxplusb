Hi Miguel, 
I hope you enjoyed the bbq and the rest of your time in Geneva. For me last night, I ended up heading back to the apartment where the party was full on and danced until the sun came up, and then kept going. Very cathartic. It's been a long time since I last cryed and you certainly caught me on an interesting day. Anyways, I decided that instead of sending you the first chapter, I'd send you the first piece that I wrote, which is a partial chapter that will fit in eventually, maybe chapter 3. The reason I keep being so secretive about this book is that it's fiction, but it's centered around CERN. Obviously a dangerous topic for someone who works there. On top of that, my goal is to look into the lives of people who interact with CERN, which means talking about things like gender, race, culture, internationalism, bias, inspiration, depression, ambition, etc. and also to explain some physics to a nonscientist audience. Pretty ambitious, and very possibly contriversial, who knows what I'll end up writing. It's also possible that I won't be able to pull it off, but for now I'm at least enjoying writing it. So I'm sending you this first part because I think it wouldn't be the end of the world if it got out (though I hope it doesn't), and I'll send you chapter 1 if you ask for it.
Peace,
Tom
